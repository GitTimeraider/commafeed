# CommaFeed fork with PUID and PGID environmentals

Google Reader inspired self-hosted RSS reader, based on Quarkus and React/TypeScript.

This is a fork of [Athou/commafeed](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed). All credit for the application itself goes to
the upstream project.

![preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1256795/184886828-1973f148-58a9-4c6d-9587-ee5e5d3cc2cb.png)

## What's different in this fork

- The Docker image supports `PUID`/`PGID` environment variables, so the application can run as any user/group (e.g.
  `99:100` on unRAID) and match the ownership of your `data` directory.
- A single Docker image is published to `ghcr.io/gittimeraider/commafeed` (H2 embedded database, native build,
  `linux/amd64`) on every push, instead of the upstream Docker Hub images.
- The CI pipeline is trimmed down to building and publishing that one image. Pull requests run the unit tests; pushes
  skip tests to publish faster. It does not create GitHub releases or publish precompiled packages.
- Dependencies (Maven, npm, Docker base images and GitHub Actions) are checked weekly by Dependabot instead of Renovate.
- Upstream files this fork doesn't use (the JVM Dockerfile, the release script and Renovate/stale-bot/sponsor configs)
  are removed. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) is kept as-is: it's the upstream project's changelog.

See [Maintaining this fork](#maintaining-this-fork) for how to pull in upstream changes and keep things up to date.

## Usage

### Docker

```
docker run --name commafeed --detach --publish 8082:8082 --restart unless-stopped \
    --volume /path/to/commafeed/data:/commafeed/data \
    --env PUID=99 --env PGID=100 \
    --memory 256M ghcr.io/gittimeraider/commafeed:latest
```

The app will be accessible on http://localhost:8082/. See
[commafeed-server/src/main/docker/README.md](commafeed-server/src/main/docker/README.md) for docker-compose examples,
image tags and `PUID`/`PGID` details.

> **Hardening with `--cap-drop=ALL`?** `PUID`/`PGID` can't work then, because switching user needs capabilities that
> flag removes. Use `--user 99:100` instead of `PUID`/`PGID`, and make sure your data directory is already owned by
> that user/group on the host. See
> [Using `--cap-drop=ALL`](commafeed-server/src/main/docker/README.md#using---cap-dropall----security-optno-new-privilegestrue)
> for details and unRAID steps.

### Build from sources

    ./mvnw clean package [-P<database> [-Pnative]] [-DskipTests]

- `<database>` can be one of `h2`, `postgresql`, `mysql` or `mariadb`. The default is `h2`.
- `-Pnative` compiles the application to native code. This requires either GraalVM to be installed (`GRAALVM_HOME` environment
  variable pointing to a GraalVM installation) or a container environment to be available (docker/podman/...).
- `-DskipTests` to speed up the build process by skipping tests.

When the build is complete:

- a zip containing all jars required to run the application is located at
  `commafeed-server/target/commafeed-<version>-<database>-jvm.zip`. Extract it and run the application with
  `java -jar quarkus-run.jar`
- if you used the native profile, the executable is located at
  `commafeed-server/target/commafeed-<version>-<database>-<platform>-<arch>-runner[.exe]`

If available for your operating system, the native build is recommended because it has a faster startup time and lower
memory usage.

## Configuration

CommaFeed doesn't require any configuration to run with its embedded database (H2). The database file will be stored in
the `data` directory of the current directory.

To use a different database, you will need to configure the following properties:

- `quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url`
    - e.g. for H2: `jdbc:h2:./data/db;DEFRAG_ALWAYS=TRUE`
    - e.g. for PostgreSQL: `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/commafeed`
    - e.g. for MySQL:
      `jdbc:mysql://localhost/commafeed?autoReconnect=true&failOverReadOnly=false&maxReconnects=20&rewriteBatchedStatements=true&timezone=UTC`
    - e.g. for MariaDB:
      `jdbc:mariadb://localhost/commafeed?autoReconnect=true&failOverReadOnly=false&maxReconnects=20&rewriteBatchedStatements=true&timezone=UTC`
- `quarkus.datasource.username`
- `quarkus.datasource.password`

There are multiple ways to configure CommaFeed:

- a `config/application.properties` [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) file relative to the working
  directory (keys in kebab-case)
- Command line arguments each prefixed with `-D` (keys in kebab-case)
- Environment variables (keys in UPPER_CASE)
- a `.env` file in the working directory (keys in UPPER_CASE)

When in doubt, the properties file is recommended because CommaFeed will be able to warn about invalid properties and typos.

All [CommaFeed settings](https://athou.github.io/commafeed/documentation) (upstream documentation, which also applies to
this fork) are optional and have sensible default values.

When logging in, credentials are stored in an encrypted cookie. The encryption key is randomly generated at startup,
meaning that you will have to log back in after each restart of the application. To prevent this, you can set the
`quarkus.http.auth.session.encryption-key` property to a fixed value (min. 16 characters).
All other Quarkus settings can be found [here](https://quarkus.io/guides/all-config).

When started, the server will listen on http://localhost:8082.

### Securing your instance

- CommaFeed serves plain HTTP on port 8082. If it's reachable from outside your local network, put it behind a reverse
  proxy that terminates HTTPS (e.g. Nginx Proxy Manager, Caddy, Traefik or SWAG) instead of exposing the port directly.
- Set `quarkus.http.auth.session.encryption-key` (`QUARKUS_HTTP_AUTH_SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` as an environment
  variable) to a long random value, so logins survive restarts. Keep it secret: anyone with it can forge login cookies.
- Leave `commafeed.http-client.block-local-addresses` at its default (`true`) unless you need feeds from your local
  network, and then only if you trust every user of your instance (see the [FAQ](#faq)).
- Use a non-root `PUID`/`PGID` for the Docker image (the container refuses `0`), and optionally
  `--cap-drop=ALL` with `--user` as described in the [Docker README](commafeed-server/src/main/docker/README.md).

### Updates

The Docker image is rebuilt on every push to this repository. To update, pull `ghcr.io/gittimeraider/commafeed:latest`
again and recreate the container (on unRAID: **Docker** tab → **Check for Updates** → **Apply Update**).

`latest` changes with every push to `master`. If you'd rather update deliberately, use a pinned tag like
`master-a1b2c3d` (one exact commit) and change it when you choose to; the available tags are listed on the
repository's GitHub page under **Packages** → `commafeed`.

### Memory management

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is rather greedy by default and will not release unused memory to the
operating system. This is because acquiring memory from the operating system is a relatively expensive operation.
This can be problematic on systems with limited memory.

#### Hard limit (`native` and `jvm` builds)

The JVM can be configured to use a maximum amount of memory with the `-Xmx` parameter.
For example, to limit the JVM to 256MB of memory, use `-Xmx256m`.

#### Dynamic sizing (`jvm` build)

In addition to the previous setting, the JVM can be configured to release unused memory to the operating system with the
following parameters:

    -Xms20m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:-ShrinkHeapInSteps -XX:G1PeriodicGCInterval=10000 -XX:-G1PeriodicGCInvokesConcurrent -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=5 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=10

See [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/gctuning/garbage-first-g1-garbage-collector1.html)
and [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/gctuning/factors-affecting-garbage-collection-performance.html) for
more
information.

#### OpenJ9 (`jvm` build)

The [OpenJ9](https://eclipse.dev/openj9/) JVM is a more memory-efficient alternative to the HotSpot JVM, at the cost of
slightly slower throughput.

IBM provides precompiled binaries for OpenJ9
named [Semeru](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/downloads/).
The upstream project uses it for its JVM Docker image; this fork only publishes the native image.

## FAQ

### Getting "Access to local address blocked" when adding a feed

CommaFeed blocks access to local resources by default to prevent [SSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_request_forgery) attacks.
If you want to subscribe to feeds that are only available on your local network, you can disable this security measure by setting the `commafeed.http-client.block-local-addresses` variable to `false`.
Do this only if you trust all users of your CommaFeed instance not to access private resources.

### Listen on a single network interface

By default, CommaFeed listens on all interfaces. You can restrict it by setting `quarkus.http.host`.

Note that if you set it to a local name like `127.0.0.1` host validation is enabled automatically. This prevents
access if you're using a reverse proxy like Nginx. To fix, add your actual hostname to `allowed-hosts`:

```
quarkus.http.host=127.0.0.1
quarkus.http.proxy.proxy-address-forwarding=true
quarkus.http.proxy.allow-forwarded=true
quarkus.http.host-validation.allowed-hosts=commafeed.example.com
```

## Translation

Files for internationalization are located in [commafeed-client/src/locales](commafeed-client/src/locales).

To add a new language:

- add the new locale to the `locales` array in:
    - `commafeed-client/.linguirc`
    - `commafeed-client/src/i18n.ts`
- run `npm run i18n:extract`
- add translations to the newly created `commafeed-client/src/locales/[locale]/messages.po` file

The name of the locale should be the
two-letters [ISO-639-1 language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

## Local development

### Backend

- Open `commafeed-server` in your preferred Java IDE.
    - CommaFeed uses Lombok, you need the Lombok plugin for your IDE.
- run `./mvnw quarkus:dev`

### Frontend

- Open `commafeed-client` in your preferred JavaScript IDE.
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`

The frontend server is now running at http://localhost:8082 and is proxying REST requests to the backend running on
port 8083

## Maintaining this fork

### Pulling in upstream changes

Dependabot only updates dependency versions. Fixes to CommaFeed's own code (including security fixes) only arrive
when you sync from [Athou/commafeed](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed), so do this regularly, e.g. when upstream
publishes a release.

If there are no conflicts: on this repository's GitHub page, click **Sync fork** (above the file list), then
**Update branch**.

If GitHub reports conflicts, merge on your own computer instead, in a terminal inside your clone of this repository:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Athou/commafeed.git   # only needed the first time
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
# resolve the conflicts (see below), then:
git push origin master
```

Conflicts can only happen in the files this fork changed. How to resolve them:

| Files | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Deleted in this fork: `.github/FUNDING.yml`, `.github/stale.yml`, `renovate.json`, `release.sh`, `commafeed-server/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm` | Keep them deleted: `git rm <file>` |
| Changed in this fork: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `commafeed-server/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native`, `README.md`, `commafeed-server/src/main/docker/README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` | Keep this fork's version, but copy over upstream changes that still apply (e.g. a newer base image on the `FROM` line of `Dockerfile.native`) |
| `pom.xml`, `commafeed-client/package.json` (upstream and Dependabot bumped the same dependency) | Take the higher version |
| `commafeed-client/package-lock.json` | Don't edit by hand: take either side, then run `npm install` in `commafeed-client` to regenerate it |

Pushing the merge to `master` builds and publishes a new image automatically.

Nothing in this repository depends on the upstream repository, so the fork can be detached later (GitHub Support can
do this). After that the **Sync fork** button disappears and you no longer receive upstream fixes, but CI, Dependabot
and the Docker image keep working unchanged.

### Dependency updates (Dependabot)

[.github/dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml) checks Maven, npm, the Docker base image and GitHub Actions every
Monday. Minor and patch updates are grouped into one PR per ecosystem; major updates get their own PR. Dependabot keeps
at most 5 PRs open per ecosystem, so merge or close them to get new ones. Each PR runs the unit tests and builds the
image; merging it publishes a new image.

For security fixes as soon as they're announced (rather than weekly), enable **Dependabot alerts** and **Dependabot
security updates** under **Settings** → **Code security** on this repository's GitHub page.

Dependabot can't see these versions, so bump them by hand now and then:

- `GOSU_VERSION` in [Dockerfile.native](commafeed-server/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native). The `sha256` checksums
  in the same `RUN` step must be updated too, or the build fails. Get them with
  `curl -fsSL https://github.com/tianon/gosu/releases/download/<version>/gosu-amd64 | sha256sum` (and the same for
  `gosu-arm64`).
- `node.version` and `npm.version` in [commafeed-client/pom.xml](commafeed-client/pom.xml).
- `google-java-format.version` in [commafeed-server/pom.xml](commafeed-server/pom.xml).

While the fork is still attached, upstream updates the last two for you when you sync.

### CI and images

[.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs:

- **On every push**, to any branch: builds the native image without running tests and publishes it to
  `ghcr.io/gittimeraider/commafeed` as `<branch>` and `<branch>-<short-sha>` (plus `latest` for `master`). Commits
  that only change `.md` files, and pushes to Dependabot's own branches, are skipped.
- **On pull requests**: runs the server and client unit tests and builds the image, without publishing anything.
- **Manually**: **Actions** tab → **ci** → **Run workflow**.

Every branch push leaves images behind in the registry. To clean them up, open **Packages** → `commafeed` on this
repository's GitHub page, then **Package settings** / the version list, and delete versions you no longer need. Don't
delete the version currently tagged `latest`, or one you've pinned on your server.
