entrypoint: Fix it in one of these ways:
entrypoint:  1. Recommended: remove PUID/PGID and let Docker start the container as that user,
entrypoint:     e.g. add: --user ${PUID}:${PGID}
entrypoint:     (unRAID: Edit container > Advanced View > Extra Parameters)
entrypoint:     Your data directory must already be owned by ${PUID}:${PGID} on the host.
entrypoint:  2. Keep PUID/PGID and allow only the capabilities needed to switch user:
entrypoint:     --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=SETUID --cap-add=SETGID
